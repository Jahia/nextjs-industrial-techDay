# The Jahia Nextjs initiative : *Next.js App*

The aim of the Jahia Nextjs initiative is to explore and explain
the Jahia capabilities to easily create and manage headless web project.
Solutions we use are :
- [Jahia][jahia-website] : a Cloud / On-premise *DXP* solution to create and contribute
- [Vercel][vercel-website] a next-js Cloud platform provider to render the web project

To know more about the Jahia Nextjs initiative [read this dedicated page][initiative.md].

## Prerequisite
This github repository is one of three in the initiative and corresponds to the next.js
app part. This app start as a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [create-next-app]. Then the jahia team created templates and components to render
web pages created, configured and contributed in Jahia. This application cannot run alone
without its backend content.

> Please be sur you have an up and running environment before to continue.
> To know more about the setup of this app [read this dedicated page][setup.md].

To know more about the architecture [read this dedicated page][archi.md]

## Create a component


<!--
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/HalfBlock.js.disabled`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
